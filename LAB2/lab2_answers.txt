Question 1: How many look-up tables does the design use?

There are 3 LUTs in the design.

Question 2: How many registers are used in the design?

There are no registers used in the design because there is no memory needed.

Question 3: How many ports have you defined in the entity?

We defined 9 ports in the entity but there are 14 I/O counts in the eloborated design.

Question 4: Compare the eloborated design to synthesized design at the schmantics level - what is the difference?

The synthesis design takes the logic and the components; then it compresses all to LUTs.

Question 5: Does the design fulfill all the timing requirements? What were those?

We didnt have any timing constraints.
