Question 1. Can you find a reason, why we should not use 125MHz system clock for button pulser and FSM? 


Using a 125 MHz system clock for the button pulser and the finite state machine (FSM) for RGB channel selection in a design may not be ideal for several reasons:

1. Unnecessary Complexity and Resource Usage:

High Frequency Operation: At 125 MHz, the logic inside the button pulser and FSM would need to handle transitions and checks at a very high rate. This can add unnecessary complexity and potentially consume more FPGA resources (like flip-flops and logic blocks) than needed.

Debounce Handling: Button debouncing typically deals with human-scale actions (presses and releases), which occur over milliseconds. Operating at 125 MHz for debouncing would mean processing a lot of redundant clock cycles where no actual change in button state occurs.

2. Power Consumption:

Increased Power Draw: Higher frequency operation leads to increased power consumption. For tasks like button debouncing and LED control, which don't require high-speed processing, using such a fast clock is inefficient and wastes power.

3. Timing and Synchronization Issues:

Timing Challenges: At higher frequencies, timing closure becomes more challenging. You might encounter issues where the logic cannot complete its operation within one clock cycle, leading to timing violations.

Synchronization Overhead: If other parts of your system operate at lower frequencies, you'll need additional synchronization logic to interface the high-speed logic with slower parts, adding to design complexity.

4. Reduced Noise Immunity:

Sensitivity to Noise: Faster clock edges are more susceptible to noise, which can be particularly problematic for inputs like buttons that are prone to bouncing and external disturbances.

Conclusion
For tasks such as button debouncing and FSM for LED control, a lower frequency like 1 kHz is more appropriate. It matches the scale of human interactions better, saves power, reduces complexity, and avoids unnecessary challenges related to high-frequency digital design. The 125 MHz clock is more suitable for operations that genuinely require high-speed processing.
